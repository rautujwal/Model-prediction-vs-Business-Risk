# Model Prediction vs Business Risk 
 
## Overview 
This project explores insurance data to build predictive models and analyze their impact on business risk. The main objective is to determine whether the predicted prices are creating business risks such as revenue risk or loyalty risk, helping stakeholders identify potential financial impacts from prediction errors. 
 
## Project Contents 
- INSURANCE DATASET.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development. 
- model REST API and Front end.py - Python script for serving the model through a REST API and integrating with a front-end interface. 
- model prediction vs business risk dashboard.twbx - Tableau dashboard for visualizing predictions and business risk. 
- Dashboard 3.png and model execution with api.png - Screenshots of dashboards and model execution. 
- Code pdf.pdf - Documentation of code and methodology. 
- .gitignore - Specifies files and folders to ignore in Git. 
- README.md - Project documentation.
